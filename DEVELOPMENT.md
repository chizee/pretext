## Development Setup

Install once:

```sh
bun install
```

### Day-To-Day

- `bun start` — stable local page server at <http://localhost:3000>
- `bun run start:windows` — Windows-friendly fallback without automatic port cleanup
- `bun run check` — typecheck, lint, and dead-code scan (`knip`)
- `bun test` — durable invariant suite
- `bun run test:wrapping --browser=all` — complete maintained checks and selected regressions against a fresh pinned-main comparison
- `bun run test:wrapping --suite=full --browser=all` — also run the broad exploratory wrapping matrices

The report-server tests use temporary loopback ports; sandboxed runs need local
listener access. They do not launch browsers.

See [the wrapping suite](tests/wrapping/README.md) for worktree comparisons,
known-failure reporting, native observation limits and reproducible case IDs.

### Packaging And Release

- `bun run build:package` — emit `dist/` for the published ESM package
- `bun run package-smoke-test` — pack the tarball and verify temporary JS + TS consumers
- `bun run site:build` — build the static demo site into `site/`
- `bun run generate:bidi-data` — refresh the checked-in simplified Unicode bidi ranges
- `bun run generate:line-break-data` — refresh the checked-in projected Unicode line-break class table; `--check` compares it with `scripts/unicode/LineBreak-17.0.0.txt`

### Browser Accuracy And Benchmarking

- `bun run test:wrapping:snapshot` — run the suite and refresh accuracy/corpus snapshots from that run
- `bun run test:wrapping --family=pre-wrap --browser=safari` — select one family for diagnosis
- `bun run benchmark-check --output=benchmarks/chrome.json` — refresh the Chrome benchmark snapshot; default is the median of 3 full page runs, use `--runs=1` for a quick local check
- `bun run benchmark-check --browser=safari --output=benchmarks/safari.json` — refresh the Safari benchmark snapshot
- `bun run justification-check` — demo line geometry and source continuity at reported widths; use `--browser=safari` or `--full` for all slider widths
- `bun run probe-check --text='...' --width=320 --font='18px serif'` — one-paragraph browser diagnostic; also `--browser=safari`, `--method=span|range`, `--whiteSpace=pre-wrap`, `--wordBreak=keep-all`, `--lang`, `--dir=rtl`
- `bun run font-probe --browser=chrome --output=/tmp/font-probe.json` — optional Shantell Sans and font-language diagnostic; also accepts `safari` and `firefox`. See [FONT_DIAGNOSTICS.md](FONT_DIAGNOSTICS.md).
- `bun run probe:arabic-joining --output=/tmp/pretext-ff-arabic --font=arial-16 --limit=20` — Firefox-only joined-Arabic study; see [FONT_DIAGNOSTICS.md](FONT_DIAGNOSTICS.md).

Failed benchmark reports retain their evidence in `<output>.failed.json`, or under
`.artifacts/benchmarks/` when no output path was requested.

Benchmarks require a visible, focused page throughout and reject observed window,
viewport or screen changes. The three runs must have matching environments before
we take their median; snapshots retain each run's request and environment.
Foreground Firefox sessions request activation of the owned tab and process by
PID; a headed window alone does not establish focus.

For portable Chrome correctness checks, use `bun run test:wrapping --transport=playwright --browser=chrome`. This launches installed Chrome in an isolated headed browser with its native viewport. Install Chrome normally first; the adapter uses `playwright-core` without downloading another browser. Safari continues to use the native macOS path; Playwright WebKit is not treated as Safari. This transport is for correctness checks only; Playwright can emulate focus, so its visible/focused fields do not prove native tab attention. Benchmark scripts retain foreground native automation.

When a probe finds a first-break mismatch, the report includes a short trace. `sN:gM` identifies a segment and grapheme; `[ours]` and `[browser]` identify the competing break positions. Safari `Range` extraction can be wrong around preserved whitespace and URL queries even when the rendered height is correct, so compare `--method=span` before changing the engine. Assign Range points to lines with the harness `pointLine()` rule, never `rects[0]`: Safari gives a line-initial character a zero-width rect at the end of the previous line.

### Corpus Tooling

- `bun run corpus-check --id=ko-unsu-joh-eun-nal 300 600 800` — diagnose one corpus at one or a few widths; add `--browser=safari`, `--diagnose`, `--method=span|range`, `--sliceStart=`/`--sliceEnd=`, `--font=`/`--lineHeight=`
- `bun run corpus-font-matrix --id=<corpus-id>` — same corpus under alternate fonts; also `--browser=safari`
- `bun run corpus-taxonomy --id=ja-rashomon 330 450` — group corpus mismatches by likely cause

The corpus, probe, font-matrix and taxonomy tools remain detailed investigation
tools, including source slices and alternate extractors. They do not run as a
second maintained acceptance suite.

Use existing corpus `font` / `lineHeight` overrides for font comparisons. Start
font matrices in Chrome; use Safari for follow-up smoke coverage. For
Arabic/Urdu, use normalized slices, the exact corpus font, and RTL `Range`
diagnostics. Use `Range` for Thai/Lao/Khmer/Myanmar too; span probing can change
their line breaks. Derive diagnostic lines from `layoutWithLines()` and source
offsets from prepared segments and grapheme cursors. Do not duplicate the line
walker or reconstruct offsets from `line.text.length`. Small automation reports
can use the hash; large batched reports need the local POST side channel. A
timeout in the `posting` phase points to report transport first. Scripted
checkers use temporary `--no-hmr` servers. Connection-refused tabs after
teardown are expected; use `bun start` for a persistent dev server.

## Useful Pages

- `/demos/index` — index of the public demos
- `/accuracy` — checked-in accuracy snapshots produced by the shared suite
- `/benchmark` — performance comparisons
- `/corpus` — long-form corpus diagnostics
- `/font-probe` — whole-run, isolated-grapheme, in-context and language-bound font measurements; see [FONT_DIAGNOSTICS.md](FONT_DIAGNOSTICS.md)

## Current Snapshots

Use these for the current checked-in results:

- [accuracy/chrome.json](accuracy/chrome.json), [accuracy/safari.json](accuracy/safari.json), [accuracy/firefox.json](accuracy/firefox.json) — accuracy totals, environment/source fingerprints and mismatching cases; complete rows are in the run artifacts
- [accuracy/letter-spacing.json](accuracy/letter-spacing.json) — results from the small Chrome + Safari `{ letterSpacing }` check
- [benchmarks/chrome.json](benchmarks/chrome.json), [benchmarks/safari.json](benchmarks/safari.json) — raw benchmark snapshots
- [corpora/chrome-step10.json](corpora/chrome-step10.json), [corpora/safari-step10.json](corpora/safari-step10.json), [corpora/firefox-step10.json](corpora/firefox-step10.json) — checked-in browser `step=10` corpus sweep snapshots

## Deep Profiling

For one-off performance and memory work, start with `bun start` and an isolated, foreground Chrome using a throwaway profile. Reproduce the issue on [pages/benchmark.ts](pages/benchmark.ts), or on a smaller dedicated page when the benchmark is too broad.

Bun/Node microbenchmarks are useful for quick experiments, but browser behavior needs browser measurements.

For algorithmic changes, scale both source length and the number of segments,
preferred breaks, forced lines and rich items. Include repeated punctuation,
Arabic joins, CJK keep-all, long hyphenated URLs and internal whitespace runs.
Count visited boundaries and submitted Canvas text, with cold caches, before
relying on timings; doubling an input should not quadruple repeated work.
The history and current bounds are recorded in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md).
