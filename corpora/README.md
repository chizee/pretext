# Corpora

Starter long-form stress corpora for browser-layout experiments.

These files are checked in so we have stable canaries when probing languages and
punctuation systems beyond the current 7680-case browser sweep. The main corpus
set is wired into `/corpus` and the long-form rows on `/benchmark`; the checked-in
`step=10` snapshots are the compact source of truth for current results.

Machine-readable metadata lives in `sources.json`.

Machine-readable corpus status lives in [chrome-step10.json](chrome-step10.json),
[safari-step10.json](safari-step10.json) and [firefox-step10.json](firefox-step10.json).
"step=10" means the `300..900` sweep.
Mismatch taxonomy and steering vocabulary live in `TAXONOMY.md`.

The corpus page is also available locally at `/corpus?id=<corpus-id>`.
